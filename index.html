    <h1>Find a github repository from any date by using any word</h1>
    <p>
      Using GitHub's repository search API, the user is able to access a lot of data
      useful for github repositories such as date, languages, or number of stars
    </p>
    <p>
      I found this API in a GitHub repo which included many public access free 
      APIs. The link is https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis
    </p>
    <p>
      This API can help people keep track of their own code as well as competitor's code.
      For example if company a and company b are competing maybe company a wants to know 
      how quickly other people are working on the same idea they can use this api to filter 
      github search results.
    </p>
    <p>
      This API can also help people who want inspiration on what to develop next, 
      for example maybe they can research software trends and see where the most 5 
      star repositories are coming from and then maybe delve into that area next.
    </p>
    <p>
      I made use of this api by allowing the user to specify a date and a word
      to find certain repositories that relate to the specified keyword on the given date.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Think of any random word and enter it in the first input box</li>
      <li>Fill in a date in the form YYYY-MM-DD; for example 2020-04-20 and fill it in the second box</li>
    </ol>
    <form id="search-form">
      <label for="input-word"><strong>Custom Query:</strong></label>
      <input type="text" id="input-word" name="input-word" placeholder="enter random word"/>
       <input type="text" id="input-date" name="input-date" placeholder="date in form: YYYY-MM-DD form" />
      <button type="button" id="search-button" onclick="search()">Search</button>
    </form>
    <div id="all-repo-cards"></div>
  </body>
